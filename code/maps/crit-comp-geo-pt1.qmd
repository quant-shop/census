# Introduction

I outline the technical documentation for the Fall 2025 [Quantitative Histories Workshop](https://quant-shop.github.io){target="_blank"} series on [*Critical Computational Geographies*](https://quant-shop.github.io/events.html#fall){target="_blank"}. In this particular section, we focus on questions about indicators used to quantify segregation. This section is part of a long-term project of the Quantitative Histories Workshop focused on exploring the dynamic features of context in probability and high-dimensional data.


## Conceptual Model

High-dimensional data are characterized by the relationship between the data's dimensions (the number of features) and the data sample (number of observations). In an ideal interdisciplinary model that is informed by the various fields of human development, there is a potential to understand how the number of data features relate to the sample, and what methodological selections are used to characterize the set of indicators used in a mathematical model (Sørensen, 1978). 

We will use U.S. census data to consider a measure of dissimilarity and spatial maps to: (1) observe land and coverings of different variables that quantify race, and (2) engage in assessing the various spatial conditions that inform racial isolation, or a series of dividing walls that separate one group from another group ([Short, 2011](https://plus.maths.org/content/dividing-walls-topology-and-topography-i){target="_blank"}).


### Example: A Theory of Dividing Walls

![A sample dividing wall separating one group from another group](img/figureb.png)

Short's (2011) *Dividing Wall's Theorem* presents a simplified topological equivalence to consider the conditions of segregation and isolation when a population of individuals are split into two groups. In the current instance, we will examine dissimilarity in a measure of Black and non-Black populations over some geographical area, $G$.

![Is there a dividing wall?](img/figurec.png)

> *Theorem 1.* Given any configuration of blue and green towns, there is a dividing wall that separates blue towns from green towns.

![Visual proof of Short's (2001) Dividing Wall's Theorem](img/figured.png)

In the conceptual analysis above, there were only two tracts present and they completely segregated the two groups by the dividing wall. This conceptual model is a base example: two groups, two tracks, complete segregation.

## Computational Model

The index of dissimilarity will be used to quantify the evenness with which Black residents are distributed relative to other non-Black racial groups across census tracts. Our current analysis builds on the perspectives that these base measures may be foundational in understanding and quantifying the dimensions of antiblackness in high-dimensional data sources. 

The index of dissimilarity, $D$, is a demographic measure of the evenness with which two groups are distributed across geographic units within a larger geographical area. The measure quantifies the percentage of one group that would need to relocate to achieve an even distribution across all units in the geographical area. A value of $D = 0$ corresponds to complete integration, while $D = 1$ indicates complete segregation.


$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \left| \dfrac{a_i}{A} - \dfrac{b_i}{B} \right|
$$

where

- $N$ is the number of geographic units (e.g., census tracts),
- $a_i$ is the population of group A (e.g., Black residents) in unit $i$,
- $A$ is the total population of group A,
- $b_i$ is the population of group B (e.g., non-Black residents) in unit $i$,
- $B$ is the total population of group B.

$D$ measures the unevenness or lack of even distribution between Black and non-Black residents across the geographical units of a region $G$. The index $D$ takes on values from $0$ (complete integration) to $1$ (complete segregation) and represents the fraction of a group's population that would need to relocate to achieve an even spatial distribution. For example, if $D = 0.60$, 60% of one group would need to move to different areas to achieve integration.

### Example: Hypothetical City Census Tracts

We can build on the hypothetical example provided by [Dr. Rodney Green (n.d.)](https://coascenters.howard.edu/dissimilarity-index-tutorial){target="_blank"} where he offers a tutorial of the dissimilarity index. In the example, Green (n.d.) models five tracts containing between 10 and 200 residents. I recreate Green's example below:

Consider the following hypothetical city with five census tracts.

*Table 1: Hypothetical distribution of Black ($B$) and White ($W$) households across five census tracts with intermediate calculations toward the Index of Dissimilarity.*

| Tract | $b_i$ | $w_i$ | $\dfrac{b_i}{B = 300}$ | $\dfrac{w_i}{W = 500}$ | absolute difference |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1     | $b_1 = 50$                         | $w_1 = 10$      | 0.1667      | 0.0200      | 0.1467                  |
| 2     | $b_2 = 200$                        | $w_2 = 40$      | 0.6667      | 0.0800      | 0.5867                  |
| 3     | $b_3 = 10$                         | $w_3 = 100$     | 0.0333      | 0.2000      | 0.1667                  |
| 4     | $b_4 = 30$                         | $w_4 = 200$     | 0.1000      | 0.4000      | 0.3000                  |
| 5     | $b_5 = 10$                         | $w_5 = 150$     | 0.0333      | 0.3000      | 0.2667                  |
|      |                         |      |       |       | $\sum =$ 1.47                |



where,

- $B = \sum b_i = 300$ is the total number of Black households,
- $W = \sum w_i = 500$ is the total number of White households.

In Green's example, the index of dissimilarity $D$ is computed as follows:

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\textcolor{red}{N}}  \left| \frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{w_i}{W} \right|
$$


with $N=5$ we update our index:

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\textcolor{red}{5}} \left| \frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{w_i}{W} \right|
$$

we then update our population, where $B = \sum b_i = 300$ and $W = \sum w_i = 500$.

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{5} \left| \frac{b_i}{\textcolor{blue}{B = 300}} - \frac{w_i}{\textcolor{blue}{W = 500}} \right|
$$

So we now have:

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^5 \left| \frac{b_i}{300} - \frac{w_i}{500} \right| 
$$

We then subsitute our values in the expansion, starting with total populations:

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \left( 
\left| \frac{b_1}{300} - \frac{w_1}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{b_2}{300} - \frac{w_2}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{b_3}{300} - \frac{w_3}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{b_4}{300} - \frac{w_4}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{b_5}{300} - \frac{w_5}{500} \right|
\right )
$$

and then values from each neighborhood in the numerators:

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \left(
\left| \frac{50}{300} - \frac{10}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{200}{300} - \frac{40}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{10}{300} - \frac{100}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{30}{300} - \frac{200}{500} \right| +
\left| \frac{10}{300} - \frac{150}{500} \right|
\right)
$$



or, more succinctly:

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^5 \left| \frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{w_i}{W} \right| = \frac{1}{2} (0.1467 + 0.5867 + 0.1667 + 0.3000 + 0.2667) = 0.7334
$$


Green notes that 73.3 percent of either Black households would need to relocate to another tract to achieve an even distribution. In his discussion, Green first holds the White population constant in each tract and points to [Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964){target="_blank"} when "White neighborhoods became available to Black households that previously had been constrained, by law and extra-legal practices, to live in densely populated inner cities" (Green, n.d.). He then presents the example when there is a swap to achieve racial parity across the census tracts. We modify the model and diverge from Green's example toward another end, based on our theoretical framework centered on segregation as one measure of antiblackness (Hudson & McKittrick, 2014; King, Navarro, Smith, 2020).

# Research Question

How segregated are Black residents from other racial groups across census tracts, as quantified by the index of dissimilarity, $D$? 

# Data and Methods

For this analysis, we will use data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which includes information from the [decennial census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html){target="_blank"} and the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.html){target="_blank"} 5-year estimates from the `tidycensus()` package (Walker, 2023). Additional insights are gathere from Lu et al. (2014).

There are some essential items needed to generate our maps and begin our investigations. First, please make sure you have requested and stored your [Census API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) for easy access. Next, you will need to get set up in R and the [R and the RStudio IDE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/&ved=2ahUKEwjHgNqLouWPAxX8FlkFHS1VCBoQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2_EHeeDq6zN5gnktCVwGMF){target="_blank"} (or [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/){target="_blank"}) and load the necessary packages and libraries. 

Finally, you will need to select a geographical area that you would like to explore.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# Install packages as needed
# install.packages(c("tidycensus", "tidyverse", "mapview", "mapgl", "quarto"))

# Load your Census
#CENSUS_API_KEY='your_api_key'

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidycensus)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(viridis)
library(scales)
```

## Model Assumptions

We will suppose that a geographical area, $G$, consists of $N$ tracts such that $$G = \{g_1, g_2, g_3, ...g_N\} = \{tract_1, tract_2, tract_3, ..., tract_N\}$$

where,

- $G$ is the set of census tracts that fully cover a geographical area,
- $g_i$ is the $i$-th tract such that $g_1 =$ tract 1, $g_2 =$ tract 2, $g_3 =$ tract 3, ..., 
- $N$ is the number of geographic units (e.g., census tracts)

We assume that $G$ can be modeled by discrete data over a minimum population of $n$ individuals, where there is at least one individual in each unit, i.e., $n \ge N$ (so that no unit in $G$ is empty, i.e., all geographical units contain at least one individual).

We also modify the group meanings in the model to attend to the theoretical framework centered on measures of segregation that support our continued understanding of antiblackness. Specifically, we have:


$$
\hat{D} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \left| \dfrac{b_i}{B} - \dfrac{o_i}{O} \right|
$$

where

- $N$ is the number of geographic units (e.g., census tracts),
- $b_i$ is the population of Black residents in unit $i$,
- $B$ is the total population of Black residents,
- $o_i$ is the population of non-Black (other) residents in unit $i$,
- $O$ is the total population of non-Black (other) residents.

# Findings

## DC

Given the structure of DC, we begin with `geography = "tract"`.

```{r, output=F, message=F, warning=F}
dc_tracts <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(black = "B02001_003", # Black/African American population alone
                total = "B01001_001" # Total population
  ),
  state = "DC",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = T,
  output = "wide"
)

dc_tracts %>% 
  head()
```

### Black population

We then plot our data to get an initial visual of Black population.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(dc_tracts) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = blackE)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", 
                       na.value = "grey50",
                       labels = comma) + # this is where we apply the scales lib
  labs(title = "Estimated Black Population by Census Tract in DC (2023)",
       fill = "Population") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Non-Black population

We then create a non-black estimate.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dc_tracts <- dc_tracts %>% 
  mutate(nonblackE = totalE - blackE) %>% # non-black = total pop - black pop
  select(GEOID, blackE, nonblackE, totalE)

#View(dc_tracts)
```

And the data for non-Black individuals.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(dc_tracts) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = nonblackE)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", 
                       na.value = "grey50",
                       labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Estimated Non-Black Population by Census Tract in DC (2023)",
       fill = "Population") +
  theme_minimal()
```


---

Now that we know our maps feature is working, we begin our investigation.
 

### Index of Dissimilarity

We first make a `dc_black_pop` data frame.

```{r, output=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Get Black population by tract in DC
dc_black_pop <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B02001_003",  # Black alone
  state = "DC",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = T
) %>%
  mutate(estimate_black = estimate)
```

We then grab the total population by tract in DC, we will call it `dc_total_pop`.

```{r, output=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Get total population by tract in DC
dc_total_pop <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B01003_001",  # total population
  state = "DC",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = F # note that we have geometry turned off here
) %>%
  mutate(estimate_total = estimate)
```

We then combine the black population with the total population.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dc_combined <- left_join(dc_black_pop, dc_total_pop, by = "GEOID") %>%
  mutate(estimate_nonblack = estimate_total - estimate_black) %>%
  st_as_sf()
```

We then check our combined data with the other estimates.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dc_combined %>% 
  relocate(GEOID, estimate_total) %>% 
  arrange(desc(estimate_black)) %>% 
  head()
```

We then calculate the proportion of Black people in all DC tracts.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
total_black <- sum(dc_combined$estimate_black, na.rm = TRUE) # this is represented by big B 
total_nonblack <- sum(dc_combined$estimate_nonblack, na.rm = TRUE) # this is represented by big O

dc_combined <- dc_combined %>% 
  mutate(proportion_black = estimate_black / estimate_total)
```

Now we can view the top 10 tracts with the highest proportion of Black individuals.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dc_combined %>%
  mutate(proportion_non_black = 1 - proportion_black) %>% 
  arrange(desc(proportion_black)) %>% 
  select(GEOID, proportion_black, proportion_non_black) %>% 
  head(n = 10)
```


We can also calculate the proportion of tracts that are above a certain threshold of Black only individuals. Here we set the threshold at tracts with 75 percent or more Black residents.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dc_combined %>%
  # Count how many tracts have proportion_black >= 0.75
  summarise(
    total_tracts = n(),
    tracts_above_threshold = sum(proportion_black >= 0.75),
    proportion_above_threshold = mean(proportion_black >= 0.75)
  )
```

We see that one-fourth of all DC tracts have a population of more than 75 percent Black.

Finally, we calculate $D$.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dissimilarity_dc = 0.5 * sum(abs(
  (dc_combined$estimate_black / total_black) -
  (dc_combined$estimate_nonblack / total_nonblack)
), na.rm = TRUE)
```

We print our result.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dissimilarity_dc
```


Values between roughly 0.3 to 0.6 indicate moderate segregation; above 0.6 is high segregation. In this instance, the model result suggests significant residential segregation by race in DC. We close by visualizing our result and the potential [dividing wall](#conceptual-model).

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# we need to manually convert our combined data frame to include simnple features
dc_combined <- st_as_sf(dc_combined)

ggplot(dc_combined) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = proportion_black), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", direction = -1) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Black Residents by Census Tract in DC",
       fill = "Proportion Black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Is there a dividing wall?

Given that our model result indicate a significant measure of segregation, we proceed with identifying the dividing wall. The maps we have viewed up to this point give us a clear view of where that wall may be.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dc_combined <- dc_combined %>%
  mutate(majority_black = proportion_black > 0.5)
```

We'll join geometries by group.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Union geometries by group
union_black <- dc_combined %>%
  filter(majority_black) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry))

union_nonblack <- dc_combined %>%
  filter(!majority_black) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry))
```

We then calculate boundary (difference) between groups (shared border).

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
boundary_line = 
  st_intersection(st_boundary(union_black), st_boundary(union_nonblack))
```

We then plot the base polygons for the dividing wall.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dc_combined, aes(fill = majority_black), 
          color = "grey40", 
          alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = boundary_line, 
          color = "red", 
          size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Dividing Wall Between Majority Black and Non-Black Areas") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## NC

DC is a special case since it is a city-state.

For NC, we'll use `geography = "county"` and then make our way down to `tracts`.

---

### County-level data

```{r, output=F, message=F, warning=F}
nc_counties <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = c(black = "B02001_003", # Black/African American population alone
                total = "B01001_001" # Total population
  ),
  state = "NC",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = T,
  output = "wide"
)

# Add county FIPS code by extracting first 5 digits of GEOID
nc_counties <- nc_counties %>%
  mutate(county_fips = substr(GEOID, 1, 5)) %>% 
  relocate(GEOID, county_fips)

#View(nc_counties)
```

We can take a `glimpse` of our data.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
head(nc_counties) %>% 
  select(GEOID, county_fips, NAME, blackE, totalE)
```

#### What counties have the highest and lowest proportions of Black people?

We first view the data for counties with the largest Black populations.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
nc_counties %>% 
  arrange(desc(blackE)) %>%  # desc is descending order
  head(n=10)
```

Alternatively, we can view counties with large proportions of Black residents.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
nc_counties %>% 
  mutate(prop_black = blackE / totalE) %>% 
  relocate(GEOID, prop_black) %>% 
  arrange(desc(prop_black))
```

We see that Bertie County, NC has the highest proportion of Black people in the state, but only by a small margin. Alternatively, in the code below, we see that Yancey, Graham, Mitchell, and Haywood counties have the lowest proportion of Black people in the state.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
nc_counties %>% 
  mutate(prop_black = blackE / totalE) %>% 
  relocate(GEOID, prop_black) %>% 
  arrange(-desc(prop_black))
```

These maps will vary by state, and there are many directions to go to from this point. For example we could do some of the following:

- Examine counties with the highest proprtion of Black residents and gather a measure of residential segregation,
- Examine counties with the lowest proportion of Black residents and gather a measure of residential segregation,
- Look specifically at those counties with high numbers of white individuals as a proxy for other to assess the relationship to counties with low or high proportion of Black individuals as a basic model of segregation

Here is where theory meets our computational practice.

### Mecklenburg County, NC

I will select my home county: Mecklenburg County, NC for further investigation.

```{r, output=F, message=F, warning=F}
meck_tracts <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    black = "B02001_003",      # Black or African American alone
    total = "B01001_001"       # Total population
  ),
  state = "NC",
  county = "Mecklenburg",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = TRUE,
  output = "wide"
)

meck_tracts %>% 
  head()
```

#### Black population

We then plot our data to get an initial visual of Black population.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(meck_tracts) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = blackE), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", na.value = "grey50", labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Estimated Black Population by Census Tract in Mecklenburg County, NC (2023)",
       fill = "Population") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Non-Black population

We then create a non-black estimate.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_tracts <- meck_tracts %>% 
  mutate(nonblackE = totalE - blackE) %>% 
  select(GEOID, blackE, nonblackE, totalE)
```

And the data for non-Black individuals.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(meck_tracts) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = nonblackE)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", 
                       na.value = "grey50",
                       labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Estimated Non-Black Population by Census Tract in DC (2023)",
       fill = "Population") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

### Index of Dissimilarity

We can calculate the proportion of Black people in all Mecklenburg tracts.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_tracts <- meck_tracts %>% 
  mutate(proportion_black = blackE / totalE) %>%
  mutate(proportion_non_black = 1 - proportion_black)
```

Now we can view the top 10 tracts with the highest proportion of Black individuals.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_tracts %>%
  arrange(desc(proportion_black)) %>% 
  select(GEOID, proportion_black, proportion_non_black) %>% 
  head(n = 10)
```

As we did before, we can also calculate the proportion of tracts that are above a certain threshold of Black only individuals. Here we set the threshold at tracts with 60 percent or more Black residents given the size of the state.

Note that we need to remove the geometry feature before summarizing.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_tracts %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%   # Remove geometry to treat as normal data.frame
  summarise(
    total_tracts = n(),
    tracts_above_threshold = sum(proportion_black >= 0.60, na.rm = TRUE),
    proportion_above_threshold = mean(proportion_black >= 0.60, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Approximately 10 percent of tracts have a Black population greater than or equal to 60 percent in NC.

Finally, we calculate $D$ for the county.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_total_black <- sum(meck_tracts$blackE, na.rm = TRUE)
meck_total_nonblack <- sum(meck_tracts$nonblackE, na.rm = TRUE)

dissimilarity_meck <- 0.5 * sum(abs(
  (meck_tracts$blackE / total_black) - 
  (meck_tracts$nonblackE / total_nonblack)
), na.rm = TRUE)
```

We print our result.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
dissimilarity_meck
```

Values between roughly 0.3 to 0.6 indicate moderate segregation; above 0.6 is high segregation. In this instance, the model result suggests significant residential segregation by race in Mecklenburg County. We close by visualizing our result and the potential dividing wall.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(meck_tracts) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = proportion_black), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", direction = -1) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Black Residents by Census Tract in DC",
       fill = "Proportion Black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Is there a dividing wall?

Given that our model result indicate a significant measure of segregation, we proceed with identifying the dividing wall. The maps we have viewed up to this point give us a clear view of where that wall may be.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_tracts <- meck_tracts %>%
  mutate(majority_black = proportion_black > 0.5)
```

We’ll join geometries by group.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Union geometries by group
meck_union_black <- meck_tracts %>%
  filter(majority_black) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry))

meck_union_nonblack <- meck_tracts %>%
  filter(!majority_black) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry))
```

We then calculate boundary (difference) between groups (shared border).

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
meck_boundary_line = 
  st_intersection(st_boundary(meck_union_black), st_boundary(meck_union_nonblack))
```

We then plot the base polygons for the dividing wall.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = meck_tracts, aes(fill = majority_black), 
          color = "grey40", 
          alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = meck_boundary_line, 
          color = "red", 
          size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Dividing Walls Between Majority Black and Non-Black Areas in Mecklenburg County, NC") +
  theme_minimal()
```

From an analysis of history regarding the region, and contextual knowledge about the urban make-up of Charlotte, NC, which is the major proportion of the area, there is clear evidence of white flight given the shape of the dividing wall.

Where might you go from here?

# Coda

While the index of dissimilarity offers a clear and interpretable measure of segregation, it is only one facet of complex social dynamics. Future work could extend this analysis by incorporating:

- Isolation and clustering indices to capture different aspects of segregation.
- Temporal dynamics to assess how patterns shift over time.
- Qualitative data integration to contextualize spatial patterns with lived experiences.
- Policy evaluation assessing impacts of urban planning and housing initiatives.

This technical file lays the foundation for quantitative historical geography research by demonstrating reproducible workflows with open Census data and modern R tools. The methodologies presented can be readily adapted to other metropolitan areas and demographic groups for comparative analyses.

Continued interdisciplinary collaboration will deepen our understanding of spatial inequality and support informed efforts to foster equitable communities.
